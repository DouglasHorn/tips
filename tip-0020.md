#Abstract
Limit the Telos Foundation Launch Group rewards so no one entity or group gets more than 1/3 (currently 2 Million) TLOS.
The idea of the pie slicing method was a more even distribution of the founder's pool, and this just makes sure 
it is distributed in a more evenly manner.

#Modivation
The white paper called out for each APB to receive 1 million, and the pie slicing app was started to make a fair distribution, 
this just goes a little further in the even distribution.

#Rationale
This comes from the spirit of the white paper in trying to have a rewards pool to reflect the work people have put in to 
get this network launched and stable, but trying to be fair to all the participants. The white paper calls for distribution of
1 million TLOS to each of the 6 APBs, then the pie slicing app was brought out to make the distribution to more people working
the project. However by limiting the amount any one organization can get should make the distribution more in line with the
white paper's intent
