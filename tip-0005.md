# Abstract

This proposal outlines a plan to standardize Token Registries across the Telos Network, as well as define a common interface for inter-registry communication.

# Motivation

As the Telos Network grows, standardized communication interfaces will become necessary in order to allow token transactions between registries. Declaring a network-wide standard will allow any tokens developed on Telos to be reused by other applications.

# Rationale

In the Telos Network, a token or groups of tokens are collectively tracked and managed by a single contract, which will henceforth be known as a Token Registry. Due to the free nature of the network, anyone can write their own Token Registry, which will likely result in a multitude of different interfaces across the network that may or may not be able to communicate with each other.

# Specification

The TIP-5 Single Token Registry Standard defines an interface that allows for inter-registry communication and on-chain third-party support for token contracts that implement a single token. The interface is defined as follows:

### Tables

* `typedef multi_index< N(balances), balance> balances_table`

    The `balances` table will hold all accounts and their respective token balances. The table is indexed by `account_name`.

* `typedef multi_index< N(allotments), allotment> allotments_table`

    The `allotments` table will hold all approved account allotments, indexed by the token owner's `account_name`.

* `typedef eosio::singleton<N(singleton), setting> settings_table`

    The `settings` singleton holds all token related information such as `max_supply` and `name`.

### Structs

* `setting`

    `issuer` refers to the account authorized to mint new tokens.
    `max_supply` asset holds the maximum supply of tokens to be allowed in circulation.
    `supply` asset stores the total tokens currently in circulation.
    `name` holds the human-readable name of the token.
    `is_initialized` represents whether the token has been initialized.

* `balance`

    `owner` refers to the account that owns the tokens.
    `tokens` asset holds the balance of tokens owned by the owner.

* `allotment`

    `owner` refers to the account that owns the tokens that have been allotted.
    `recipient` refers to the account that has the authority to withdraw from the `tokens` field.
    `tokens` asset holds the allotment to be withdrawn by `recipient`.

### ABI Actions

* `init()`

    Used to initialize the new token contract. See `sample.registry.cpp` for examples.

* `void mint(account_name recipient, asset tokens)`

    Mints new tokens into the circulating supply.

* `void transfer(account_name owner, account_name recipient, asset tokens)`

    Transfers `tokens` from the `owner` account to the `recipient` account.

* `void allot(account_name owner, account_name recipient, asset tokens)`

    Allows `recipient` to withdraw from the `owner` account, multiple times, up to the value of `tokens`. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allotment with `tokens`.

* `void transferfrom(account_name owner, account_name recipient, asset tokens)`

    Transfers `tokens` from the `owner` allotment to the `recipient` account, up to the amount defined by the `owner`'s call to the `allot()` action.

### Functions

* `void sub_balance(account_name owner, asset tokens)`

    Safely subtracts the `tokens` balance from `owner`'s account.

* `void add_balance(account_name owner, asset tokens, account_name payer)`

    Safely adds the `tokens` balance to `owner`'s account. Charges `payer` with resource consumption.

As stated in TIP-3 Option A, the eosio.token contract will be modified to serve as a Master Registry that maintains a running table of all other Token Registries. By calling `registertoken()` on the Master Registry contract, the calling account registers an independently written Single Token Registry. Registering an independent contract in this way will add the contract information to a table managed by the Master Registry.

# Discussion

* Who pays for the resources consumed by calling these actions?
    
    Suggestion: The account that pays for the ram consumption is context dependent. For example, `owner` provides the ram when calling `approve()`.

* Does this interface only work for single token contracts?

    Answer: Yes. A forthcoming Multi Token Registry Standard will declare an interface for interacting with contracts that implement 1 or more tokens on a single contract.

# Summary for Shareholders

The changes suggested in this TIP will declare a standard for developing token contracts. All future token contracts adhering to this standard will be able to communicate and transfer assets amongst one another. This will also pave the way for contract integration with exchanges and other third-party developers.
