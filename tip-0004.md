# Abstract
This proposal defines some guidelines to improve how account names are created in Telos, and what we can do to prevent impersonating and provide trademark protection.

# Motivation
Name squatting already happened on EOS main net during the first minutes of launch process when a few BPs got their names registered by someone else. Now there is a case of impersonating a BP account (Ctyptolions) that is used for a scam and main net is unable to do anything to fix it. Many users/companies are interested in buy affordable premium names, with less than 12 characters.

# Rationale
1. There is no trademark/name/domain protection on EOS main net.
2. There is no process to claim a squatted name account.
3. Premium names are part of a bidding process but only 1 a day is released. That means many names will never be released.
4. There is no mechanism to buy vanity names.

# Specification
1. Arbitration in name squatting cases. TF should be able to transfer squatted account names to legal trademark or internet domain holder.
2. TLD domains (.com,.net,.org...etc) should be controlled by TF and accounts using it can be sold like any other internet domain.
3. Premium and vanity names: any user should be able to buy premium names (6-11 characters).
4. All name purchases should be paid in TLOS and should be handled by smart contracts.
5. Premium names may be granted before main net activation to individuals, BPs, DAPPs and Exchanges involved in launch process. This process must be open to everyone.

# Name prices
1. TLD: 100 TLOS* (any .com, .net, .org, etc... subdomain). Can be freely bought but account owner must be rquired to prove copyright/trademark ownership. First-come, first-served.
2. Premium names-vanity names, brand Names/trademark (max 6-12 characters): 100 TLOS*
3. High Value names: (3-5 characters): to be decided (10,000 TLOS*)

*All prices are subject to change. This is only a proposal. 

# Special names

1. BPs in launching group will be able to reserve up to 5 names related to its brand and projects they sponsor before main net open to public.
2. DAPPs committed to launch in Telos main net during the first 3 months will have 5 free account names (TLD or/and Names/trademark) as part of the Telos DAPPs Welcome Pack. All names can be reserved before main net is open. This should be advertised in advance across the media channels, and added to Telos selling points.

# What to do with Fees from name selling?
1. Burn them all (reducing inflation)
2. Distribute among staked users generating passive income
3. Create a fund for DAPPs grants
4. Use them for Workers Proposals
5. Create an insurance fund for stolen/hacked accounts

In my opinion, we either should burn them all or distribute among staked users for passive income. The insurance fund for stolen/hacked accounts is also something we should consider.

# Special cases
1. b1 name account should be preserved
2. There must be a Telos Foundation account.
3. Block Producers account names from EOS Main Net must be preserved if the BP requires it. We should reach them with the offer. This does not imply any support to Telos but we do want to prevent impersonation. We must protect those names (see Cryptolions impersonation/scam account on main net for example).
