# Abstract
 
For a fair and equitable distribution of Telos Foundation Voter Tokens (TFVT) based on the pie slicing app woulf like to 
propose a cap of 5 TFVT. 

# Motivation

As it is now the higher slices will get 10 TFVT, and it is broken into 10 percentile groups. We would like it broken up 
5 percentile groups making a much closer vote potential from lowest to highest, this will empower everyone to vote and think 
their vote counts and is important.

# Rational

We want the Telos Foundation to be a tight knitted group and this will help along those lines by decreasing the number of TFVT
the higher pie slots would have.

# Specification

That the pie slicing app participants be split into 5 groups with the lowest group getting one TFVT and the highest group 
getting 5 TFVT
