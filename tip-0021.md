 # Abstract
 
 There should be a commission for the important team called the APB who will launch this network
 
 # Motivation
 
 This is a hard working group that without we would have no network, I feel this is mearly a commission that has been 
 overlooked.
 
 # Rational
 
 There should be an incentive to become part of the APB team, as this is taking away vital BP prep time.
 
 # Specifications
 
 The proposed schedule from the Bounty System call was for the APB director team (4 teams) as reccommended by all the WG
 chairs to receive a commission of 1500 slices and the members of the APB group to get a commission of 3500 slices.
 That means the 4 director teams would get a total of 5000 slices, and the other members would get 3500 slices.
