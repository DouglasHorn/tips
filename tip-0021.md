 # Abstract
 
 There should be a commission for the important team called the APB who will launch this network
 
 # Motivation
 
 This is a hard working group that without we would have no network, I feel this is mearly a commission that has been 
 overlooked.
 
 # Rational
 
 There should be an incentive to become part of the APB team, as this is taking away vital BP prep time.
 
 # Specifications
 
 I propose a commission of 20,000 for up to 10 APBs
