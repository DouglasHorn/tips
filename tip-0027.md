# Abstract

This tip proposes that 2 RAM accounts are setup before launch.

1. tf.ramadmin: This account will buy ~1.1GB of RAM (the RAM reserve) before launch with 40,000 TLOS from the TF budget. The objective of this account is to perform short term interventions on the RAM price (the 3rd instrument of the RAM administrator. See https://medium.com/@teloslogical/telos-interim-ram-administration-director-position-paper-ace4aaf7c467 ). This is comparable with a foreign exchange reserve which central banks hold and the interventions they perform with those reserves to increase or lower the exchange rate of their currency. For security the RAM Director can ONLY perform buyram, sellram and (un)delegatebw actions singly on this account. The RAM Director can not perform any other actions (especially not transfer actions). Trading profits will remain in the account. This account will be permanently available to the RAM Administration unless the TF Board decides otherwise.

2. tf.ramlaunch: This account will buy ~4.1GB of RAM before launch with 280,000 TLOS from the TF budget. The purpose of this account is to start the Bancor RAM market close to the Public Guidance Price (which will be slightly above a RAM price corresponding with a 50% RAM reserved situation) rather than at a fraction of the PGP. Having this account also enables the RAM Administration to prevent a short term spike above the PGP level by selling RAM from this account. Starting the RAM market close to the PGP takes away the most important cause for the huge price fluctuations observed after the launch of EOS. Note that this is a TEMPORARY account. The RAM Director ONLY has sellram and (un)delegatebw rights. The RAM Director will sell at a certain margin above the PGP. The proceeds will be transferred to the TF. All proceeds will go back to the Telos Foundation. This account can only deplete and will ultimately become defunct after all RAM in this account is sold and proceeds are transfered back to the Telos Foundation.

# Motivation

RAM is a scarce resource on EOSIO chains. This makes RAM attractive for speculation. Speculation and related price changes are natural but if prices become too high or too unstable it will deter developers who need to buy RAM to run their DApps. The RAM Administration has 3 instruments to influence the RAM price long term. These are described in the “RAM Administration Position Paper” on Telos Logical.

1. Publish a Public Guidance Price (PGP) for RAM every 10 Million blocks (approximately 58 days)

2. Call adhoc RAM meetings to increase RAM supply (setram). The automatic RAM growth rate (setramrate) will be set to 0 initially.

3. Trade RAM on the basis of a RAM reserve

These 3 instruments will however not avoid the heavy speculation which happened during the launch of EOS and is likely to happen again on Telos in the first hours and days after launch. This is caused by the Bancor RAM pricing mechanism (see graph 2 below) which establishes the RAM price solely on the percentage of RAM reserved until RAM is added (if RAM is added the curve effectively drops). This model makes RAM therefore relatively cheap for those speculators who get to buy first. Table 1 below shows the profits for early RAM buyers assuming they sell at the price corresponding with a 50% RAM reserved situation. During the EOS launch RAM prices and therefore profits went significantly higher as 80% to 90% RAM reserved was reached when genuine DApp buyers started to buy after the speculators had purchased the cheapest tranches.

As RAM speculators have developed sophisticated algorithms to trade and buy the first tranches of EOS RAM, the Telos RAM Administration is, without this TIP, also at risk of not being able to buy its RAM reserve (~10% of available RAM) at a competitive price. This reduces the effectiveness of the 3rd instrument mentioned above and will effectively result in an unnecessary transfer of wealth from the RAM Administration to the early speculators.

The benefits that this TIP brings therefore are:

1. The ability to maintain the PGP, as communicated before launch, directly from launch. The speculative RAM bubble at EOS has had a lasting impact on DApps. Controlling the RAM price from the start sends a clear message to DApps and speculators that Telos seeks to create a stable RAM price environment conducive to DApps and that opportunities for speculators will be limited.

2. The ability to build up a ~1.1 GB RAM reserve at a competitive price. This will prevent the RAM Administration from having to invest in a strategy and tools to buy RAM during the hectic first seconds after launch. It will also prevent that the RAM Administration is effectively helping speculators to make a quick profit.

# Rationale

The reason the RAM Administration suggests to launch the Telos chain with 50% of RAM reserved is that during the last 2 months the RAM prices at EOS Mainnet have reached a fairly constant level of ~0.1 EOS per kB (see graph 1). This price level corresponds with around 55 to 60% of RAM being reserved (see shaded area in graph 2).

As ~0.8 GB will be staked in the creation of the genesis accounts and as the chain will launch with 12GB of RAM, this means that this TIP proposed to allocate 5,2 GB of RAM before launch to the RAM Administration. The RAM Administration will sell 4.1 GB of this RAM after launch to the Bancor contract when the RAM price exceeds the PGP by a certain margin. The remaining 1.1GB will remain in the RAM reserve to allow the RAM Administration to perform short term interventions on the RAM price if and when needed.

Graph 2: Telos RAM price as a function of percentage of RAM reserved

To get a feeling for the difference between the Bancor RAM price for those first buyers and the steady state PGP and how much profit one can gain from this we have put together below table. Below table shows the RAM size which one purchases with 40k TLOS, the purchase price and profits assuming the tranch was sold at the Purchase Price of the last and most expensive tranch (i.e. close to PGP).

Table 1: Potential profit per 40k TLOS tranche
![alt text](https://github.com/TallJanSmit/tips/blob/JanSmit-TIP-27-v2/RAM_profits.png)

Selling the RAM of tranches 3 to 9 (i.e. excluding the first 1.1 GB tranch which we propose to reserve for future trading) will cause a profit of ~160k TLOS. The RAM Administration proposes to return these profits to the Telos Foundation.

Once most tranches are sold and the RAM Director is of the view that the RAM price is still too high, he/she will resort to the instruments mentioned above, specifically recommending an increase of the RAM on the chain from 12GB to a higher number.

With regard to the Telos RAM price, you can see in graph 2 above that at the 50% level the RAM price is around ~0.1 TLOS per kB (the same level as EOS today). However assuming the TLOS-USD rate will be well below the EOS-USD rate, the Telos RAM price will be well below the EOS RAM price in USD terms. Future RAM increases will reduce the RAM price expressed in TLOS (or EOS) as it moves the price curve, shown above, down . At comparable market cap of TLOS and EOS (note that this requires TLOS price to be ~3x the EOS price as EOS has 3x the token supply), at same amount of RAM (max_ram_size) and at a comparable percentage RAM reserved the RAM prices in USD will be similar for both chains.

# Security on RAM Administration accounts

The following risks, amongst others, need to be prevented:

- $5 Wrench attacks (incl extortion) on the RAM Administration
- Hacking of smart contracts which may be used by RAM Administration to trade RAM
- Fraud
To limit hacking risks we propose the following permission setup.

Table 2: RAM account permissions

It is important to note that the RAM Director never has the ability to transfer funds out of these accounts singly.

# Specifications

The Telos Launch Group is requested to approve the creation of the tf.ramlaunch and tf.ramadmin accounts before launch with the balances and access rights as specified in table 2.

# Discussion
Concerns mentioned are:
- A decentralised chain should not control 50% of RAM. Our answer: The RAM Administration is likely to sell the 4.1GB within days or weeks. If it takes longer the RAM Administration may take the opportunity to reduce the PGP and sell RAM to support the lower PGP.
- Special Privileges should not be given. Our answer: Permanent special privileges should not be given. One-off special privileges should only be given if it generates a significant benefit to the chain and no other practical option exists. We believe this is such an example.
- How can we trust the RAM Administration with the 321,000 TLOS of funds? Answer: See the added section on security above.
